## Description ##
This curriculum module contains [Simscape Multibody](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simmechanics.html)&trade; models and [live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that explore one-dimensional collisions using a virtual air track. The air track can be configured to model elastic or inelastic collisions. The live scripts contain instructions for conducting experiments using the virtual air track. The instructions include theory, pre-lab, virtual experiment, and data analysis sections. The law of conservation of momentum is studied by simulating elastic and inelastic collisions. The law of conservation of energy is studied by attaching a hanging mass to one of the carts.

Get started with the Air Track Collisions Lab by downloading and unzipping the repository. Then, double-click the project .prj file inside MATLAB&reg;. From there, you can follow the landing page instructions to get started with the lab.

**Learning Goals**
- Compare inelastic and elastic collisions.
- Use conservation laws to predict motion after collision.
- Measure the velocities of carts using photogate readings.
- Compute momentum and energy from experimental observations.
- Assess conservation of momentum.
- Assess conservation of energy.

## Details ##
