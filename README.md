**Curriculum Module**

_Created with R2021a. Compatible with R2021a and later releases._

# Information

This curriculum module contains interactive [MATLAB® live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that explore one-dimensional collisions using a virtual air track. The air track can be configured to model elastic or inelastic collisions.

<a name="H_F00D98E4"></a>
## Background

<img src="Images/image_0.png" width="770" alt="image_0.png">


You can use these live scripts as demonstrations in lectures, class activities, or interactive assignments outside class. This module covers elastic and inelastic collisions. It also includes examples of energy conservation. The live scripts contain instructions for conducting experiments using the virtual air track. The instructions include theory, pre-lab, virtual experiment, and data analysis sections. The law of conservation of momentum is studied by simulating elastic and inelastic collisions. The law of conservation of energy is studied by attaching a hanging mass to one of the carts.


The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, when an animation is in progress), use the <img src="Images/image_1.png" width="19" alt="image_1.png"> Stop button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Getting Started
### Accessing the Module
### **On MATLAB Online:**

Use the [<img src="Images/image_2.png" width="136" alt="image_2.png">](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Air-Track-Collisions-Lab&project=Air_Track_Lab.prj) link to download the module. You will be prompted to log in or create a MathWorks account. The project will be loaded, and you will see an app with several navigation options to get you started.

### **On Desktop:**

Download or clone this repository. Open MATLAB, navigate to the folder containing these scripts and double-click on  **Air_Track_Lab.prj**. It will add the appropriate files to your MATLAB path and open an app that asks you where you would like to start.
